# os32u4
A Kernel for use on 32u4 AVR chips.

This project exists to provide a low-level hardware library to help me program ATmega32u4-based Î¼Controllers. Currently, library features include:
 - Digital GPIO
 - Precise & fuzzy timekeeping
 - Timeshare-based multithreading with up to 10 threads 
   - Capibilities for IPC, task management, and freezing threads
   - Easy-to-use interface
   - Low resource usage
 - Support for interacting with 8-bit shift registers
 - Hardware USART with support for redirecting stdio over USART
 - A single-digit 7-segment display driver

All code except `vendor` code has been written by [me](https://retrylife.ca), by hand. I am using this project to help me learn my way arount the AVR ISA.

## Testbed

![My test setup](./project.jpg)

I am currently developing this library / kernel with the following:
 - Arduino Pro Micro (16mhz 5V)
 - Generic USB-FTDI converter
 - 8bit shift register
 - 7 segment display
 - A few LEDs

## Timers

The following timers are used by os32u4:

| Timer   | Resolution | Usage       |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `TCCR0` | 8bit       | Timekeeping |
| `TCCR3` | 8bit       | PWM         |
